# Modern Techniques in Machine Learning Projects
A repository containing projects for the 2018 Modern Techniques in Machine Learning (2-INF-188/17) class
at Comenius University.

The current course page containing details about the project assignments
can be foud [here](https://usamec.github.io/ml2/).


## Projects
* [Autograd](../master/autograd) - a toy implementation of an autograd engine
for automatic computation of derivatives of expressions.
* [QRNN](../master/qrnn) a TensorFlow implementation of a proposed
    alternative to RNN based on convolutions described in the paper
    [Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01576.pdf).
* [Weight Uncertainty & Bayes by Backprop](../master/bayesbybackprop) replication of the paper
    [Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05424.pdf),
    which explores a variational Bayesian NN architecture, which can be trained
    by backpropagation (and implemented for GPU). It explores the use of the
    posterior distribution of weights for quantifying uncertainty and as a tool
    for sparsification.
